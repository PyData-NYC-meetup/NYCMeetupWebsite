An open-source scientific and technical publishing system that not only enables publishing reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more--it can also be used to build websites!

## Quarto - local editing
For those interested in developing locally and who haven't used Quarto before, its possible to preview your updates locally.  To do this:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub, I did this in Windows cmd.exe.  You may need to install an SSH key to facilitate git commands, there are instructions [here](https://github.com/settings/keys).
2. After adding SSH key use `git clone git@github.com:PyData-NYC-meetup/pydata-nyc-meetup.github.io.git` to copy the files to your local disk.
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).  Open the folder where you copied the github repo.
4. Install [Quarto's Visual studio Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto&ssr=false#overview).  
5. Open a *.qmd file (I think qmd stands for Quarto MarkDown?) - e.g. about.qmd or index.qmd
6. Click the "Preview" button near the top (see screenshot 1) ![image](https://github.com/PyData-NYC-meetup/pydata-nyc-meetup.github.io/assets/51715345/12943340-b693-4ba2-8c15-acf1667bc8d6)
7. This will compile the changes and then output a preview in a split window (see screenshot 2) ![image](https://github.com/PyData-NYC-meetup/pydata-nyc-meetup.github.io/assets/51715345/683bbbd4-bd04-4761-a16d-9023fbf0de8b)
